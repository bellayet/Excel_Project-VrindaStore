# Excel_Project-VrindaStore

In this project, I made an interactive Dashboard (Annual reports 2022) for the Vrinda Store using Pivot Tables, Pivot charts, and Pivot slicer. Before that, I cleaned and processed the orders and sales data.

Sample Questions

*Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.

*Which month got the highest sales and orders?

*Who purchased more men and women in 2022?

*What are the different order statuses in 2022?

*List the top 5 states contributing to the sales.

*Relation between age and gender based on number of orders.

*Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

*Highest selling category.
